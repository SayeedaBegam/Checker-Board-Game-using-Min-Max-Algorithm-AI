# Checkers AI with Minimax

This project implements an interactive Checkers (Draughts) game in **Python**, where:
- **You** play as **Black** (human).
- **The AI** (using the **Minimax** algorithm with alpha-beta pruning) plays as **White**.
- A **Pygame** interface lets you click pieces and make moves on an 8Ã—8 checkerboard.

## Features

- **Visual Board**: Displayed using **Pygame** for a 2D interactive experience.
- **Human vs. AI**: You control **Black**, while the computer (AI) controls **White**.
- **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Evaluates possible moves to find the best outcome for the AI.
- **Forced Captures**: If a capture is available, normal (non-capturing) moves become invalid.
- **Automatic King Promotion**: Pieces become kings upon reaching the opposite end of the board.
- **Move Limit**: To prevent games from going on indefinitely, a maximum move count can be set.

## Project Structure


1. **`checkers_logic.py`**  
   - Contains board creation, rules, move generation (including jumps), and functions to apply moves.

2. **`ai_minimax.py`**  
   - Provides the Minimax algorithm (with alpha-beta pruning), an evaluation function, and a helper to find the best move for a given player.

3. **`pygame_ui.py`**  
   - Sets up a Pygame window where you (Black) can click pieces to move, and the AI (White) makes its moves automatically.

4. **`tests/`** *(optional)*  
   - Sample tests using `pytest` or `unittest` to verify the correctness of the core logic.
